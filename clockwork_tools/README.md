# Clockwork Tools python module

Mainly a way to wrap up the REST API calls to "Clockwork Cluster" in a way
that doesn't require users to know about the details of the making such requests.
It's a python wrapper, plus a little more.

The main appeal of having such a library is that we can present a python module
to Mila members and they don't have to know anything else about Clockwork.
We can polish our interface, document it, make tutorials, notebooks, and
the complexity of the tool ends at the "clockwork_tools" python module for our users.
