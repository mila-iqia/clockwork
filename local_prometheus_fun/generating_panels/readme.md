# Using the Grafana REST API

This was done to try to see how easy it was to use the Grafana REST API.

Things get messy rather quickly, and the best approach is probably to
set up all those panels with the web interface manually.

Nevertheless, it was interesting to set up those graphs and maybe
it will be useful later on to be able to populate many graphs programmatically.
