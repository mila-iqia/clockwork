"""
Many tests had duplicated logic in
    test_mt_jobs.py
    test_rest_jobs.py
    test_browser_jobs.py
because the same tests were performed at different locations
to flex different ways to access the information on the server.

As much as possible, we have put here the common logic
and we export it to those respective files.

It is less obvious how to do that with "test_browser_jobs.py"
because it would involve testing the contents of the rendered
html pages, which are not necessarily meant to display all
the information.
