# A Clockwork Cluster

Many of the "readme" files are outdate, but still contain useful pieces,
and the final layout/functionality of this repo are not known yet, so that
makes it hard to document properly.

At the time of this writing (2021-08-16), the most relevant readme file is

[setup_ecosystem/setup_using_docker_compose.md !](https://github.com/mila-iqia/clockwork/blob/master/setup_ecosystem/setup_using_docker_compose.md)

## Brief overview of folders

Used:

* clockwork_web : the web server, to be deployed by IDT
* clockwork_web_test : unit tests for "clockwork_web"

* clockwork_tools : python module to be used by Mila members in conjuction with prod instance "clockwork_web"
* clockwork_tools_test : unit tests for "clockwork_tools", running on a dev instance of "clockwork_web"

* slurm_state : work in progress, adapting the code from "slurm_monitor" to reflect the new design

Needs to be redesigned or deleted:

* docs : unsure if docs should be there, autogenerated, or elsewhere
* scripts : some functional scripts that are not necessarily part of the final "product" but are still useful

* setup_ecosystem : launch point for web server, for tests and development. needs trimming.
* slurm_monitor : this was used to fetch all the data from the slurm clusters, but should be transitioned to "slurm_state"
